# Clipboard Bullet Point Script
## Overview
This Python script allows you to quickly convert text from your clipboard into a bulleted list. Each line of the copied text will be prefixed with a `*` , and the result will automatically be copied back to your clipboard for easy pasting elsewhere. Blank lines are preserved.
